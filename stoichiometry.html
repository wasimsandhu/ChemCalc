                <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is stoichiometry?</h3>
                
                <p>Stoichiometry is a useful way to calculate the theoretical amounts of reactants needed and products created in a chemical reaction. You can find <b>stoichiometric ratios</b> based on the coefficients of a balanced chemical reaction.</p>
                
                <h4 style="text-align: center">N<sub>2</sub> + <b>3</b>H<sub>2</sub> → <b>2</b>NH<sub>3</sub></h4>
                
                <p>For example, in the above reaction, 1 mole of N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen gas) and 3 moles of H<sub>2</sub> (hydrogen gas) are needed to produce 2 moles of ammonia, or NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
                
                <p><b>Remember, a mole is just a number!</b> You could have a dozen eggs (12 eggs), a dozen cars (12 cars) or a dozen dollars ($12). In the same way, you can have a mole of eggs (6.02•10<sup>24</sup> eggs), a mole of cars (6.02•10<sup>24</sup> cars) and one mole dollars (6.02•10<sup>24</sup> dollars)!</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">How do I find the limiting reactant?</h3>
                
                <p>A limiting reactant can be thought of as the reactant that runs out first in a reaction. A reaction can only proceed as long as there are reactants. When one of the reactants runs out, the reaction stops.</p>
                
                <p>To find out which reactant runs out first, we have to use dimensional analysis to "convert" how much of the other reactant is needed. Typically, the conversion goes like this: grams of first reactant → moles of first reactant → moles of second reactant → grams of second reactant.</p>
                
                <p>Let's say we react 10.00 grams of nitrogen with 5.00 grams of hydrogen. Which reactant is the limiting reactant? Don't be tricked into thinking hydrogen because it is the least amount!</p> 
                    
                <p>You must do dimensional analysis and "convert" grams of one reactant into grams of the other reactant to find out. Which reactant should you start with? <b>It doesn't matter.</b></p>
                    
                <p>Let's start with nitrogen. <b>First, convert grams of nitrogen to moles of nitrogen.</b></p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lemQyLk.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
                
                <p><b>Second, convert moles of nitrogen to moles of hydrogen.</b> How do we compare the two? By using the stoichiometric ratio given by the equation.</p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aGskGuO.png" class="img-responsive" />
                
                <p><b>Finally, convert moles of hydrogen to grams of hydrogen.</b></p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LYNe28r.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
                
                <p>So what does this number mean? This means that, for this reaction, we need 2.16 grams of hydrogen for every 10 grams of nitrogen.</p> 
                
                <p>Because we need 2.16 grams of hydrogen and we have 5 grams, <b><em>we have more H<sub>2</sub> than we need.</em></b> Therefore, N<sub>2</sub> will run out first. With the amounts given, <b>nitrogen is the limiting reactant for this reaction.</b></p>
                
                <p>We can summarize the above dimensional analysis in a more condensed (and easier) calculation as follows:</p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/moxZMoK.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
                
                <p>What if we had started with hydrogen and calculated how many grams of nitrogen were needed? Go ahead and practice that calculation on paper following the above steps. What you will find is that the amount of N<sub>2</sub> needed for this reaction <b>will be more than</b> the amount we have, which is 10 grams.</p>
                
                <p>This is consistent with our conclusion; we have less nitrogen than is needed to react with hydrogen, therefore nitrogen is the limiting reactant.</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">How do I find theoretical yield?</h3>
                <p>Theoretical yield is the theoretical amount of product formed in a reaction. We say theoretical because the actual yield of most reactions will be less.</p>
                                
                <p>To find theoretical yield, you first need to find out which reactant is the limiting reactant. Because the reaction stops when the first reactant runs out, no more product is formed. <b>Therefore we must use the amount of limiting reactant in our calculation.</b></p>
                
                <p>We find theoretical yield using dimensional analysis, similar to how we find limiting reactants (abbreviated as LR from now on). The typical process is as follows: convert grams of LR → moles of LR → moles of product → grams of product.</p>
                
                <p>Again, similar to our LR calculation, we will compare moles of LR to moles of product using the stoichiometric ratios given in the chemical equation.
                    
                <p>Continuing from our previous reaction involving 10.00 grams of nitrogen and 5.00 grams of hydrogen, the calculation for its thereotical yield is shown below.</p>
